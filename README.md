# Get Firefox: the grassroot Firefox promotion platform and personal product page builder

[中文說明 Chinese intro](http://blog.timc.idv.tw/posts/gfx-open-for-testing/)

GetFirefox ([gfx.tw](gfx.tw)) is conceived by MozTW (Mozilla Taiwan Community). We tried to answer a basic question: if you could customize your Firefox into your own favor with add-ons, why can't you customize and promote your own product page -- with your favorate recommendations and add-on?

Users are invited be log-in with OpenID, a decentralized log-in system, and make his/her own promotion page of Firefox. The website will generate stickers for people to post on their blogs and websites.
